Your fruit stand company has some software that calculates and serves a list of products and their prices, taking into account items that are on sale and how the sales affect the total price. This software consists of three components: a base-price component which serves the base prices of fruits sold by the fruit stand, a sales component which provides a list of items that are on sale and how much each item is discounted, and a total-price component which communicates with the other two and calculates the final price for each item.

These components have been running on a single Docker host, but as your business is expanding, it is time to upgrade to a swarm cluster for greater flexibility. Run these three application components as services in your swarm cluster, and provide them with a custom overlay network to facilitate isolated communication between them.

Configure these application components on the Swarm cluster so that the following specifications are met:

1. Create an overlay network called prices-overlay-net.
2. Create a service called base-price with 3 replicas using the linuxacademycontent/prices-base-price:1 image. Configure the service to use the prices-overlay-net network.
3. Create a service called sales with 3 replicas using the linuxacademycontent/prices-sales:1 image. Configure the service to use the prices-overlay-net network.
4. Create a service called total-price with 2 replicas using the linuxacademycontent/prices-total-price:1 image. Configure the service to use the prices-overlay-net network. Expose this service's port 80 on port 8080.

If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to access the total prices list with:
curl localhost:8080.

$ docker swarm init
Swarm initialized: current node (z0l9u8j5yd0tujnviw7c9ajwf) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-506zz6ifah2mat2t001vfhe4efuuxac96jhsalp4ljugooueum-d8dsl4ti5hmwbkethxuo06kfc 172.17.0.70:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

$ docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-506zz6ifah2mat2t001vfhe4efuuxac96jhsalp4ljugooueum-d8dsl4ti5hmwbkethxuo06kfc 172.17.0.70:2377
